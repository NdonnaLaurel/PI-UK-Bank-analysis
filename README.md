# PI-UK-Bank-analysis
In this project, I analyzed customer data for PI-UK Bank, focusing on key metrics such as Customer ID, Name, Surname, Gender, Age, Region, Job Classification, Date Joined, and Balance. This dataset allowed me to assess customer demographics, account balances, and trends in banking behavior.
